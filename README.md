# Where I've Been

Where I've Been is an iOS app that lets you keep track of locations you've travelled in a list/note format. By simply holding down
on a location, you can add a new placemark on your list of travel locations you've been to. 

# Motivation

I wanted to practice using the MapKit and CoreLocation libraries in Swift, so I decided to make a app that is relatively complex and
easy to use for users. I developed the app using Swift 3.0 for iOS 10.

# Installation

To run the app, simply download the XCode project (Has to be 8.1 and above to work I believe) and run it on the simulator and/or your own
iPhone device. The app will prompt you to allow access to your location for it to work. Have fun!

This is a self-project made by myself, Mike Choe.
